**Sticky Header is applied here:**

At first **.stickyHeader** class is written in the style.css file, where a animation (property) is added which has a value "alamin" and a duration "1s (second)"

Animation "alamin" is written with a keyword **@keyframes** and has two values (from - to) of top background.

Then a JavaScript (JS) code is written in the **script.js** file. This JS code works when the page is scrolled 200px or more, by adding/removing "stickyHeader" class.
